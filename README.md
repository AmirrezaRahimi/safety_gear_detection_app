# Real-time Object Detection Project

This project demonstrates real-time object detection using YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm, specifically designed to detect personal protective equipment (PPE) in video streams.

## Features

- Real-time object detection using YOLO
- Web-based interface for easy access
- Dashboard for live statistics
- Customizable detection settings
- Responsive design for various devices

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/object-detection-project.git
cd object-detection-project

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Download the YOLO model file (ppe.pt) and place it in the `models/` directory.

## Usage

1. Start the Flask server:
python server/app.py

2. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.

3. Grant camera access when prompted.

4. The application will start detecting objects in real-time.

## Configuration

You can adjust the detection settings in the Settings page of the web interface.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request.

Additional Improvements:

Error Handling: Implement more robust error handling throughout the application, especially for camera access and network issues.
Caching: Implement caching mechanisms for detection results to reduce server load.
Testing: Add unit tests and integration tests for both frontend and backend components.
Documentation: Add inline comments and generate API documentation using tools like Sphinx.
Security: Implement security best practices, such as input validation, CSRF protection, and secure WebSocket connections.
Optimization: Profile the application and optimize performance bottlenecks, especially in the object detection process.
Accessibility: Improve accessibility features in the frontend, ensuring the application is usable by people with disabilities.
Internationalization: Add support for multiple languages in the user interface.
Analytics: Implement usage analytics to track how the application is being used and identify areas for improvement.
Deployment: Create deployment scripts and containerize the application using Docker for easier deployment and scaling.
These improvements and additional files should make your project more comprehensive, well-structured, and suitable for presentation as a significant university project. The modular design allows for easy expansion and maintenance, while the added features and documentation demonstrate a thorough understanding of web development and machine learning integration.
